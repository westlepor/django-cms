amFOSS Club Management System (CMS) is django-based web-app which lays framework for the amfoss website, the amfoss webapp, and the amfoss app. 


## :minidisc: [Installation Instructions](https://github.com/amfoss/cms/wiki/Installation)
The portal is primarily a django based application, and to set it up we require to have 
python environment with django and other project dependencies installed. Though one can
work with the project without an virtual environment,  it is recommended to use one so 
as to avoid conflicts with other projects.

1. Make sure that you have `Python 3` and `pip` installed. 
   Install `virtualenvwrapper`, and add it to your terminal path. Restart your terminal, to make the changes live.
   
    ```
       $ sudo pip install virtualenvwrapper
       $ echo 'export WORKON_HOME=~/Envs' >> ~/.bashrc
       $ echo 'mkdir -p $WORKON_HOME' >> ~/.bashrc   
       $ echo 'source /usr/local/bin/virtualenvwrapper.sh' >> ~/.bashrc   
    ```
    
2. Clone the repository, and create a virtual environment for the project, 
   and work on the newly set up environment.
   
    ```
        $ git clone https://github.com/amfoss/cms.git
        $ cd cms
        $ mkvirtualenv --python=python3 amfoss
        $ workon amfoss
    ```
    
3. Install the project dependencies from `requirements.txt`
    ```
        $ pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

You have now successfully set up the project on your environment. If you encounter any problems during installation, you can refer to [installation page on our wiki](https://github.com/amfoss/cms/wiki/Installation).

### After Setting Up
From now when you start your work, run ``workon amfoss`` inside the project repository and you can work with the django application as usual - 

* `python manage.py migrate` - set up database
* `python manage.py createsuperuser` - create admin user
* `python manage.py runserver`  - run the project locally

*Make sure you pull new changes from remote regularly.*
